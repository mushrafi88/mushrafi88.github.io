        - title: Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Quantum Computing
          company: Master's Thesis
          location: Dhaka, Bangladesh
          date_start: '2024-03-01'
          date_end: ''
          description: |2-
              - Conducting research under the mentorship of Dr. Golam Dastegir Al Quaderi in the field of quantum computing, specifically focusing on the adaptation of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to quantum computational frameworks.
              - Successfully developed multiple models that integrate classical physics equations with PINN, including the coupling of differential equations like the Lotka-Volterra model, high-dimensional coupled Higgs equation, and nonlinear Schrödinger equations.
              - Currently transitioning towards quantum machine learning-based implementations, aiming to bridge the gap between classical physics-informed modeling and quantum computing capabilities.
              - Utilizing a combination of Python, PyTorch, PennyLane, and Qiskit to construct and validate quantum-enhanced versions of physics-informed neural networks.
              - This ambitious project, serving as my master's thesis, aims to pioneer the integration of PINNs within quantum computing, potentially revolutionizing how we approach and solve physics-based problems through computational means.
        
        - title: Vaccination Decisions in a Dual Strain Disease Dynamics
          company: Research Assistant
          location: Dhaka, Bangladesh
          date_start: '2023-08-01'
          date_end: '2024-02-28'
          description: |2-
              - Worked under the guidance of Dr. Muntasir Alam from Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Dhaka to analyze the impact of vaccination considering behavioral, socio-economic factors on the dynamics of a second disease strain.
              - Integrated randomness, game theory principles, and network analysis to create a comprehensive model for disease spread in the given scenario.
              - Utilized Python, Mesa and Julia to implement multi agent based models and conducted rigorous testing.
              - Developed three distinct models to enhance the understanding of disease spread dynamics: a scale-free model where agents utilize a random scale-free graph to make vaccination decisions, a complete graph model reflecting uniform decision-making among all agents, and a stochastic model for validating our findings.
              - The comprehensive study is currently under review at the Chaos, Solitons & Fractals journal.

        - title: Quantum Machine Learning for Solar Irradiance Forecasting
          company: Research Assistant
          location: Dhaka, Bangladesh
          date_start: '2023-03-01'
          date_end: '2023-05-31'
          description: |2-
              - Worked under the supervision of Dr. Mohammed Mahbubul Islam from Institute of Energy Engineering, Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology to develop and validate hybrid classical-quantum machine learning models for solar irradiance prediction.
              - Conceptualized and initiated the project, proposing the integration of quantum layers within feedforward neural networks.
              - Utilized Python, PennyLane, Qiskit, and PyTorch to implement the models and conducted rigorous testing.
              - Engineered a novel fully connected parameterized quantum circuit tailored for solar irradiance forecasting.
              - Led the technical aspects of the project, encompassing model design, implementation, model validation and, performance evaluation.
              - Published the findings in a Q1 journal with an impact factor of 10.4.
