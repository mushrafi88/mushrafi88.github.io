title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Solving Physical Systems
summary: This repository contains implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve various physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs). PINNs leverage the power of deep learning to approximate solutions to complex physical and quantum mechanical problems by incorporating physical laws as part of their loss function.
