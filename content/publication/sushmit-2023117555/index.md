abstract: Predicting solar irradiance has proven to be a challenging task due to its
  inherently unpredictable and chaotic characteristics. Although machine learning
  and deep learning models have demonstrated considerable success in this field, the
  emergence of quantum computing brings a new layer of potential to this complex problem.
  This paper delves into these emerging methodologies, focusing specifically on their
  application in the domain of solar irradiance forecasting. This study investigates
  the integration of quantum layers into a conventional deep feedforward neural network
  (FFN) and the development of a fully connected quantum neural network (QNN). A bidirectional
  long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model is employed as a performance benchmark. Among
  the various models developed within this study, a few have demonstrated notable
  performance. For example, an FFN composed of five regular layers and two quantum
  layers (FFN5L2Q), having a total parameter count of 339, generated an error rate
  of 6.737%. Conversely, another FFN model, featuring eight regular layers and one
  quantum layer (FFN8L1Q) and having a total parameter count of 5551, exhibited superior
  performance with an error rate of 4.254%. When compared to the BiLSTM model, which
  has 49,666 parameters and an error rate of 3.875%, these quantum-enhanced FFNs display
  robust and competitive performance. This study, therefore, emphasizes the promising
  prospects of quantum-integrated techniques in augmenting the precision of solar
  irradiance prediction models.
