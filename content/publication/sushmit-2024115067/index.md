abstract: 'This paper proposes a multi-agent-based game-theoretic framework to explore
  the dynamics of decision-making among agents in a situation involving a dual-strain
  epidemic, where the emergence of the second strain is directly related to the first
  strain. It considers the impact of imperfect vaccination on dual strains within
  the SIRV framework, in a hybrid network that combines scale-free and grid-based
  structures. This research presents three models based on the level of decision-making
  of agents: Individual Decision Making (IDM), Collective Decision Making (CDM), and
  Stochastic Decision Making (SDM) model. In the IDM model, agents can continuously
  update their strategies based on the infection and vaccination statuses of their
  immediate neighbors. The CDM model offers a macro-level approach where agentsâ€™ willingness
  to vaccinate varies uniformly, while the SDM model maintains a constant level of
  willingness for vaccination across agents. This study demonstrates that agents using
  the IDM model tend to initiate vaccination earlier in scenarios of high infection
  rates, effectively mitigating the spread of the disease in subsequent epidemic seasons.
  However, when both infection and vaccination rates heavily influence decision-making,
  there is a noticeable decrease in vaccination uptake, thereby aggravating the spread
  of infection. Additionally, the authors found that in scenarios of high infection,
  an over reliance on vaccination without adequate initial uptake can jeopardize disease
  control efforts. Another important finding of this study is that despite the CDM
  and SDM models showing a quicker emergence of the second strain and reaching equilibrium
  points faster than the IDM model, the overall infection rate remains lower in the
  IDM model. This research underscores the complexity of managing dual-strain epidemics
  through vaccination strategies and highlights the significance of micro-level decision-making
  in epidemic control.'
