abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-agent-based game-theoretic framework to explore the dynamics of decision-making among agents in a situation involving a dual-strain epidemic, where the emergence of the second strain is directly related to the first strain. It considers the impact of imperfect vaccination on dual strains within the SIRV framework, in a hybrid network that combines scale-free and grid-based structures. This research presents three models based on the level of decision-making of agents: Individual Decision Making (IDM), Collective Decision Making (CDM), and Stochastic Decision Making (SDM) model. In the IDM model, agents can continuously update their strategies based on the infection and vaccination statuses of their immediate neighbors. The CDM model offers a macro-level approach where agents’ willingness to vaccinate varies uniformly, while the SDM model maintains a constant level of willingness for vaccination across agents. This study demonstrates that agents using the IDM model tend to initiate vaccination earlier in scenarios of high infection rates, effectively mitigating the spread of the disease in subsequent epidemic seasons. However, when both infection and vaccination rates heavily influence decision-making, there is a noticeable decrease in vaccination uptake, thereby aggravating the spread of infection. Additionally, the authors found that in scenarios of high infection, an over reliance on vaccination without adequate initial uptake can jeopardize disease control efforts. Another important finding of this study is that despite the CDM and SDM models showing a quicker emergence of the second strain and reaching equilibrium points faster than the IDM model, the overall infection rate remains lower in the IDM model. This research underscores the complexity of managing dual-strain epidemics through vaccination strategies and highlights the significance of micro-level decision-making in epidemic control.}

abstract = {Predicting solar irradiance has proven to be a challenging task due to its inherently unpredictable and chaotic characteristics. Although machine learning and deep learning models have demonstrated considerable success in this field, the emergence of quantum computing brings a new layer of potential to this complex problem. This paper delves into these emerging methodologies, focusing specifically on their application in the domain of solar irradiance forecasting. This study investigates the integration of quantum layers into a conventional deep feedforward neural network (FFN) and the development of a fully connected quantum neural network (QNN). A bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model is employed as a performance benchmark. Among the various models developed within this study, a few have demonstrated notable performance. For example, an FFN composed of five regular layers and two quantum layers (FFN5L2Q), having a total parameter count of 339, generated an error rate of 6.737%. Conversely, another FFN model, featuring eight regular layers and one quantum layer (FFN8L1Q) and having a total parameter count of 5551, exhibited superior performance with an error rate of 4.254%. When compared to the BiLSTM model, which has 49,666 parameters and an error rate of 3.875%, these quantum-enhanced FFNs display robust and competitive performance. This study, therefore, emphasizes the promising prospects of quantum-integrated techniques in augmenting the precision of solar irradiance prediction models.}
